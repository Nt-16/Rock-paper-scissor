# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## How to Play

1. The computer randomly chooses one of the options: rock, paper, or scissors.
2. You will be prompted to enter your choice by typing 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
3. The game then compares your choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner.
4. The winner is declared based on the following rules:
    - Rock beats scissors
    - Paper beats rock
    - Scissors beats paper
    - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
5. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py

```
